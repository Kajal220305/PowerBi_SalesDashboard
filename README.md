**ðŸ“Š Sales Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project**

This project was built using Power BI Desktop with integrated datasets related to sales, returns, GST, and platform performance. The dashboard utilizes cleaned and transformed data prepared using Power Query and DAX measures. No external database is needed to run this project.

The project includes multiple sheets such as:

Sales

Packed

RT & RTO

GstReport

Sheet3

Rstreport

These sheets form the core of our data model to analyze sales performance and operational metrics.

 **Business Objective**
This dashboard is developed to address common business queries such as:

How are sales performing across platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and the website?

What is the return and RTO rate across different regions or products?

How do tax values (GST) affect net revenue?

User stories and business needs guided the visualization goals, ensuring alignment with operational insights and sales KPIs.

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query by:

Removing null values

Correcting spelling errors

Merging datasets from different sheets

Creating calculated columns (e.g., Return Rate, Net Revenue)

** Data Modeling**
Key relationships were created between fact tables (e.g., Sales, Packed) and dimension tables (e.g., platforms, dates). Relationships were managed in Power BI's Data Model view to enable accurate filtering and drill-down capabilities.
